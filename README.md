# Cookie Notice
> Cookie Consent notice for Statamic sites

This addon provides a nice cookie consent notice for Statamic sites. All you need to do is add a tag to your site's layout.

Please note that while we aim for this addon to be compliant with European regulations, we're not responsible if it doesn't fully comply.

While this code is open-source, it's important to keep in mind that you'll need to purchase a license to use it in production. You can buy a license from the [Statamic Marketplace](https://statamic.com/marketplace/addons/cookie-notice).

## Installation

1. Install via Composer - `composer require doublethreedigital/cookie-notice`
2. Publish the Cookie Notice config and it's assets - `php artisan vendor:publish --tag=cookie-notice-config && php artisan vendor:publish --tag=cookie-notice-assets`
3. Add the notice to your site's layout `{{ cookie_notice }}`

## Configuration

During installation, you'll publish a configuration file for Cookie Notice to `config/cookie-notice.php`. The contents of said file look like this:

```php
<?php

return [

    // Name of the cookie used to store the users' prefrences
    'cookie_name' => 'COOKIE_NOTICE',

    // Consent groups
    'groups' => [
        'Necessary' => [
            'required' => true,
            'toggle_by_default' => true,
        ],
        'Statistics' => [
            'required' => false,
            'toggle_by_default' => false,
        ],
        'Marketing' => [
            'required' => false,
            'toggle_by_default' => false,
        ],
    ],

];
```

* `cookie_name` defines the name of the cookie you wish to store the users' cookie preferences.
* `groups` is an array of consent groups. Feel free to update them however you want. The key is the name of the group, which will be displayed to the user. `required` defines whether the user is absolutly required to accept cookies for that group. `toggle_by_default` will automatically check the checkbox on the consent notice, however the user will be able to uncheck it if they want.

## Usage

### Displaying the cookie notice

It's simple! Just add this to your site's layout (or wherever you want to put it)

```antlers
{{ cookie_notice }}
```

### Overriding the cookie notice

If you want some more customisation over the contents of the consent view, you can publish it to `resources/views/vendor` and edit it from there.

```
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=cookie-notice-views
```

### If user has given any consent...

If you want to check if the user has given consent to any of your consent groups, you can do this:

```antlers
{{ if {cookie_notice:hasConsented} }}
    <!-- has consented to something -->
{{ /if }}
```

### If user has consented for...

You'll want to make sure that you're only running marketing scripts when the user has consented to the Marketing consent group. To check if a user has consented to a particular group, do this:

```antlers
{{ if {cookie_notice:hasConsented group='Marketing'} }}
    <!-- marketing scripts -->
{{ /if }}
```
