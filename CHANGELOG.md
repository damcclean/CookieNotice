This release *shouldn't* be a breaking change if you're coming from v3. However, I've marked it as such in case there are any unintended side affects.

You should be able to continue using your Blade cookie notice views for as long as you like. Or if you like, you could switch it around for Antlers. It really doesn't matter which one you use.
